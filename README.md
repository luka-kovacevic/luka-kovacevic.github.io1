## Luka Kovačević

>First year PhD student at [Clare Hall](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk), and the [MRC Biostatistics Unit (BSU)](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk) under the supervision of [John Whittaker](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/t-to-z/john-whittaker/) and [Sach Mukherjee](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/h-to-m/sach-mukherjee/). The focus of my research is causal learning for single-cell genomics data with a particular focus on large-scale screening experiments. More generally, my research interests span causality, machine learning, genetics and Bayesian statistics. 

>Prior to starting my PhD, I worked on adaptive Phase I clinical trial design at the MRC BSU. I also worked on COVID-19 epidemiological forecasting at the [S3RI](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/s3ri/) in collaboration with PHE and Dstl. I obtained an MSc in Statistical Science from the University of Oxford and a BSc in Mathematics with Computer Science from the University of Southampton.
