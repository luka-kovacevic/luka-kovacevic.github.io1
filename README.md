>Iâ€™m currently a PhD student at the MRC Biostatistics Unit (BSU) and Clare Hall at the University of Cambridge with Professor John Whittaker and Professor Sach Muckerjee. The focus of my PhD is causal learning for single-cell genomics data with a particular focus on large-scale screening experiments. More generally, my research interests span causality, machine learning, genetics and Bayesian statistics.
