>I’m currently a PhD student at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit (BSU)](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk) and [Clare Hall, University of Cambridge](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk) with [John Whittaker](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/t-to-z/john-whittaker/) and [Sach Mukherjee](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/h-to-m/sach-mukherjee/). The focus of my PhD is causal learning for single-cell genomics data with a particular focus on large-scale screening experiments. More generally, my research interests span causality, machine learning, genetics and Bayesian statistics.
